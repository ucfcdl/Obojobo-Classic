These components, basic in structure and rich in media capabilities, are designed to include innovative help features and assistive guidelines to better support designers and authors throughout the development process.\r\n\r\nOur vision was to provide a tool that is both a repository and a collaborative medium that functions by facilitating learning via the finest assessment capabilities available. As a result, Obojobo was created by the CDWS staff with guidance and feedback from students, instructional designers, and faculty throughout Florida. Going forward, the development team continues to work avidly on the enhancement of Objobo’s subsequent release and the creation and implementation of innovative features.

	(33,2,'2011-05-14 15:43:18','2011-05-14 15:43:18','<strong>A Learning Object Platform</strong>\r\n\r\nOur philosophy is that the more we help creators author the best objects possible, the more we help to strengthen Obojobo. Therefore, Obojobo\'s mission is to take the open-ended concept of Learning Objects and make them functional for the virtual classroom. In pursuing this mission, Obojobo has been constructed to be a complete Learning Object platform: The Repository allows you to manage and distribute your objects, the Editor allows you to create them, and the Viewer provides the front-end interface for your students to begin learning.\r\n\r\n<strong>Message Design Principles Built-in</strong>\r\n\r\nWe have worked very hard to make sure that Obojobo not only enables creators to build Learning Objects but also helps guide creators by informing them of the most effective practices for building strong content. These guidelines have been incorporated throughout the creation process to better assist novice users. However, guidelines are also designed to be un-obtrusive to more advanced users.\r\n\r\n<strong>Collaboration Enabled</strong>\r\n\r\nObojobo allows you to build Learning Objects independently while perserving your ability to share and collaborate. You can assign friends or other users to help you design a Learning Object or you can share your Learning Object with other Obojobo users by making it available in the Obojobo public library. Your colleagues can then utilize your object and make it available to their students; or, they can expand upon the object by making constructive changes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Usability and Re-usability</strong>\r\n\r\nLearning Objects are created with the built-in guidelines and designed to represent the smallest unit of learning possible. This allows instructors to re-use each Learning Object for a variety of functions within different courses. Additionally, you can utilize the public library and build a course lesson plan quickly by utilizing Learning Objects contributed by others. Because the Learning Objects you create with Obojobo are both dynamic and malleable, you have the abilityto modify your Learning Objects in the event your content needs to be updated to keep up with changes that are pertinent to your specific field of study.\r\n\r\n<strong>Practice Makes Perfect: Especially with  Instant Feedback…</strong>\r\n\r\nSince our Learning Object model calls for opportunities to practice, learners have the ability to exercise knowledge learned in the content area without negative consequences. This function enables students to learn and apply new concepts with only a small investment of time. Meanwhile, instructor feedback is designed to assist in the learning process. The freedom a virtual classroom provides allows students to exercise their academic skills independently until they feel comfortable with the content. If students find that they initially experience difficulty, they can repeat the exercises until mastery is acquired. Once a student is completely confident that they have mastered the content, they may move on to the assessment for a final score.\r\n\r\n<strong>Assessment You Can Take with You</strong>\r\n\r\nAssessment scores are displayed in a simple interface. As faculty, you will see charts to help you organize your information. This includes advanced support for Webcourses, making it even easier for you to integrate Obojobo in your online courses. Still, student scores do not have to remain on Obojobo exclusively. You can download student scores and import them in your grade book, course management system, or any additional application you may be using.\r\n\r\n<strong>Easy to Get Started</strong>\r\n\r\nObojobo was designed to be easy to use. Help and guidelines are built- in and full documentation is available. In addition, we have also streamlined the process of creating Learning Objects into a step-by-step procedure that is both user friendly as well as exceptionally functional.\r\n\r\nFor students, the viewer is divided into four simple categories: <em>Learning Objective</em>, <em>Content</em>, <em>Practice</em> and <em>Assessment</em>. Starting with the Learning Objective, students get a quick idea of what they will be learning. Next, Content outlines the concept(s) to be addressed. Practice allows students to test their knowledge, and Assessment allows them to demonstrate what they have learned. If students have any issues, documentation and help assistance is available for them as well.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful for Pros</strong>\r\n\r\nWhile Obojobo was designed to be easy, it\'s far from simple. Adobe Captivate support means that you can create interactive practice and assessment beyond the traditional multiple choice format.\r\n\r\nIn addition, multiple permission levels means that you can specify with how other users collaborate in the development of learning objects. The road map planned for Obojobo will bring many more features that will enable users to create greater and more innovative content. We intend to continue improving upon our design and cultivating the creation of superior learning tools for the virtual environment.\r\n\r\n<strong>Times Change and so does Obojobo…</strong>\r\n\r\nObojobo is an evolving system and our current time-line includes additional features, more frequent updates, and a variety of improvements which will ultimately make Obojobo even better. As updates come through the pipe-line, we will consistently let you know about the newest and greatest innovations. In the meantime, feel free to give us feedback as many of our improvements are derived from the opinions we receive from users. User functionality and satisfaction are of utmost importance to us, and we look forward to improving your virtual learning experience.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Obojobo Features','','publish','closed','open','','obojobo-features','','','2011-12-14 22:28:00','2011-12-14 22:28:00','',31,'https://obojobo.ucf.edu/?page_id=33',0,'page','',0),

For more information on Basic and Pro accounts (and how to apply for a Pro Account), visit <a href=\"/help/instructors/basic-and-pro-accounts/\">this article</a>.\r\n\r\nThis guide is a supplement to the <a href=\"/help/instructors/quick-start-guide-for-basic-accounts/\">Basic Account Quick Start Guide</a>. The Basic Account guide covers how to use Learning Objects from the Public Library, publish Instances and collect scores. This guide assumes that you are familiar with these topics.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/about/obojobo-features/\">\r\n</a>\r\n<h2>Pro Account Users: What is the Difference?</h2>\r\nAs a Pro Account user, you have the ability to author Learning Objects as well as manage and share them with your colleagues. The Repository and Editor are the two interfaces you will use to create and manage your Learning Objects. Additionally, you are able to use the editorial tools to build high quality Learning Objects that facilitate effective learning. You can create these Learning Objects singularly or collaboratively and with permission levels that you define.\r\n<h2>Creating objects</h2>\r\nObojobo editorial tools help you to build your own Learning Objects with intutive functioning. These instructions cover the basics of how to begin constructing your own Learning Objects.\r\n\r\n<strong>Note:</strong> <em>The remainder of this guide assumes that you are logged into Obojobo. For help on logging in, refer to the <a href=\"/help/faq/\">FAQ on Logging In</a> or the <a href=\"/help/login-help/\">Login Help</a> page for more information.<em></em></em>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Navigate to the \'My Objects\' section in the Obojobo Repository.</li>\r\n	<li>Click on the purple \'Start New Draft\' button in the upper-left corner.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThis will bring up the editor interface. The editor is divided into six primary sections which will guide through the process of creating your draft Learning Object.\r\n<p align=\"center\"><em>The Editor Interface</em></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Six sections</em></p>\r\nEach section in the Editor is intended to do the following:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Overview</strong>: used to establish what your students are going to learn, or in other words, set your Learning Objective. You have two options for writing learning objectives: 1) using the Objective Builder or 2) writing the Learning Objective without any assistance.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Content</strong>: designed to organize all of the pages that make up the content within your Learning Object. You can arrange your text and media files by choosing from a set of different page layouts.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Practice</strong>: created to organize interactive exercises, simulations and quizzes so that your students can practice what they learned in the content section.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Assessment</strong>: intended to provide formal assessment as indicators of academic progress with the Learning Objective you set for your students.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Metadata</strong>: used to define basic information about your Learning Object including language, description, some keywords and the estimated time of completion.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Finish</strong>: created to assist you in polishing your Learning Object so that it is ready for distribution.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Drafts &amp; Masters</h2>\r\nNow is a good time to briefly cover some terminology. In the Obojobo system, Learning Objects can come in two forms: Drafts &amp; Masters.\r\n\r\nWhen you create a new Learning Object, it starts life as a Draft Object. As the name implies, a Draft Object is an incomplete Learning Object. As a result, the only people who will see your Draft Object are you and any collaborators you decide to add to your Draft Object. Students will never see your Draft Object.\r\n\r\nIn Obojobo, each Draft Object has a corresponding version number. Every new draft begins at version 0.1. Each time you save, your draft\'s version number will increase - from 0.1 to 0.2, 0.2 to 0.3 and so on.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to drafts, which are evolving works in progress, Master Objects are polished, complete, and set in stone. Master Objects are ready for student viewing and capable of being incorporated into courses.\r\n\r\nBoth Drafts Objects and Master Objects are shown in the \'My Objects\' section of the Repository.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the difference between a Draft Object, Master Object and an Instance, please read the <a href=\"/help/instructors/drafts-masters-instances/\">Drafts, Masters &amp; Instances</a> article.\r\n<h2>Saving Learning Objects</h2>\r\nAs you build your Learning Object it is important to remember to save your work by clicking on \'Save\' button on the lower right side of the Obojobo Editor. Each time you save, the version number of your Draft Object will increase (0.1 to 0.2, 0.2 to 0.3, and so on).\r\n<h2>Editing Learning Objects</h2>\r\nThe above information covers how to begin a brand new Learning Object. However, eventually you will need to close your Learning Object and come back to it later. In addition, other Obojobo users may grant you permissions to edit their Learning Objects. In both of these cases, you will be editing an existing Learning Object. To successfully edit and existing Learning Object please follow the simple directions provided below:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>In the Repository, navigate to the \'My Objects\' tab.</li>\r\n	<li>Select the desired saved Draft Object from the listing on the left-hand side of the screen.</li>\r\n	<li>Click on the purple \'Continue Editing\' button. This will launch the Editor interface, allowing you to continue working where you left off.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhile constructing your Learning Object, please refer to these guides for helpful information:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"/help/instructors/building-content/\">Content</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"/help/instructors/text-guidelines/\">Text Guidelines</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"/help/instructors/adding-media/\">Media Assets</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"/help/instructors/building-practice-questions/\">Practice</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Previewing Learning Objects</h2>\r\nThere are two methods of previewing Learning Objects you create. If you are in the Obojobo Repository, you can preview any Learning Object by selecting it in the \'My Objects\' section and clicking the purple \'Preview\' button.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you are actively editing a Learning Object using the Editor, you can use the \'Preview Student View\' button in the lower right-hand corner of the screen.\r\n\r\nBoth of these buttons will open the Learning Object.Viewing your Learning Object in “Preview Mode” will give you an idea of how your work will be viewed by students.\r\n<h2>The Final Step</h2>\r\nWhen you have finished creating your Learning Object, you will need to finalize it by converting  your Draft Object into a Master Object.\r\n\r\nThis action is accomplished by navigating to the ‘Finish’ section in the Obojobo Editor. This will open up the ‘Master Checklist\'. ‘The Master Checklist’ will list any problems found in your Learning Object, such as a missing question or a blank Content page. You will need to go through the checklist and resolve these issues before your Draft Object can be finalized. This step is required to ensure that all Learning Objects created in Obojobo are complete.\r\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Master Checklist</em></p>\r\n<strong>Note:</strong> <em>Before continuing, please be aware that you cannot directly edit Master Objects. If you finalize your Draft Object into a Master Object, you will need to create a new Master Object if you would like to make changes. Therefore, please review your Draft Object and make sure you are satisfied with your it before finalizing into a Master Object.</em>\r\n\r\nAfter completing the items in the ‘Master Checklist’, click on the \'Create Master...\' button at the top of the checklist pane.This will bring up a dialog asking you to confirm. Click on the blue button to complete the procedure. Afterward, dismiss the success dialog to close the Editor and return to the Repository, where your newly created Master Object will be automatically selected.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Deployment: Publishing Instances</h2>\r\nPublishing Instances from your Master Object is very similar to publishing Instances from the Public Library (which is described in detail in the <a href=\"/help/instructors/quick-start-guide-for-basic-accounts/\">Basic Account Quick Start Guide</a>). First, select your Master Object from the \'My Objects\' section. Then, click on the purple \'Publish Instance\' button.\r\n\r\n<strong>Note:</strong> <em>You can publish instances from Master Objects, but you cannot publish Instances from Draft Objects. If you do not see the \'Publish Instance\' button, then you have selected a Draft Object instead of a Master. Since Draft Objects are works in progress, they are not complete and cannot not be seen by students.<em></em></em>\r\n<h2>Viewing &amp; Downloading Scores</h2>\r\nViewing &amp; Downloading Scores is covered in depth in the <a href=\"/help/instructors/quick-start-guide-for-basic-accounts/\">Basic Account Quick Start Guide</a>.\r\n<h2>Continuing Development</h2>\r\nOnce created, your Master Objects will remain intact. However, you may want to improve or modify your Master Objects. This is possible by creating a new Draft Object series from a Master Object.\r\n\r\nThe direction for this process are provided below:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Navigate to the \'My Objects\' section of the Repository.</li>\r\n	<li>Select the Master Object you wish to modify.</li>\r\n	<li>Click on the purple \'Edit as New Draft\' button.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThis will pull up the Editor, allowing you to begin working on a new version of your Master Object. When you finalize your new Draft Object, it will become the next version (2.0, 3.0, etc) of your Master Object. Note that creating a new version of your Master Object does not remove the older versions. Your 2.0 Master Object can co-exist with version 1.0. Should you decide to remove one Master Object, other Master versions will remain intact. In addition, if you decide to delete a Draft Object, any related Masters will not be deleted.\r\n\r\nRefer to <a href=\"/help/instructors/drafts-masters-instances/\">Drafts, Masters &amp; Instances</a> for more information on this topic.\r\n<h2>Final Word</h2>\r\nThis completes this quick start guide. For more information on the topics discussed in this guide, as well as information on topics not discussed, please review the Obojobo <a href=\"/help/\">help index</a> for a complete listing of all help articles.\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy using Obojobo.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Quick Start Guide for Pro Accounts','','publish','closed','open','','quick-start-guide-for-pro-accounts','','','2011-12-20 16:36:22','2011-12-20 16:36:22','',468,'https://obojobo.ucf.edu/?page_id=49',0,'page','',0),

Generally, Learning Objects are fairly small in scope and size, and pertain to a specific concept. We wanted to bring Learning Objects to UCF in a way that was systematic, effective, and innovative while still maintaining usability. The project began with a peer reviewed journal article, <a href=\"http://ijklo.org/Volume1/v1p163-179Thompson.pdf\">Practical Guidelines for Learning Object Granularity from One Higher Education Setting</a>, written by CDL employees associated with the Obojobo project.\r\n\r\n<strong>Learning Objects in Obojobo</strong>\r\n\r\nIn our model, Learning Objects consist of the following elements:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Learning Objective</span></strong> - Each Learning Object can address only one Learning Objective. This Learning Objective includes the following information:</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Task</em>: What will the learner perform or complete?</li>\r\n	<li><em>Conditions</em>: Under what conditions should the learner complete the objective?</li>\r\n	<li><em>Criteria</em>: To what degree should the learner achieve this objective?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n	<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Content</span></strong> – Content describes the material addressed within a Learning Object. Below are some of the considerations regarding Content:</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Content in a Learning Object should be clear and concise.</li>\r\n	<li>Consider the inclusion of outlines with main or key concepts and principles; however, bulleted items, such as PowerPoint presentations, are not independently sufficient. Remember, students will be accessing these Learning Objects on their own; thus, you will not be able to expand on the bulleted items.</li>\r\n	<li>Some of the most effective methods of organizing content are overviews, definitions of vocabulary, descriptions, demonstrations, diagrams, flowcharts, concept maps, and examples communicatuing contrast (i.e.good vs. bad).</li>\r\n	<li>Content may be in the form of text, audio, video, interactive media or a combination of any of these.</li>\r\n	<li>Organize your content in individual sections consisting of a maximum of 250 words per screen. This approach will increase the usability of the content from a learner’s perspective.</li>\r\n	<li>When organizing your Content, establish a hierarchy of importance and maintain this approach throughout the design of the Learning Object.</li>\r\n	<li>Be consistent in how the information is organized throughout the Learning Object.</li>\r\n	<li>Content should include no more than five minutes of any one media type at a time.</li>\r\n	<li>Text, video, audio, images or interactive media conveying the facts, concepts, processes, procedures and/or principles of the subject matter should be included.</li>\r\n	<li>Although writing styles differ from person to person, a conversational tone is appropriate in the design of Learning Objects to maximize reader engagement.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n	<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Practice</span></strong> - A Learning Object provides opportunities for learners to review facts, key concepts and principles through exercises, instructional games, simulations, problem solving and guided reflections. UCF provides both customized instructional widgets and applications that can be incorporated into the Practice section of Learning Objects. Alternatively, practice may be provided through quiz-type self-tests (i.e., multiple choice, true-or-false, etc.)</li>\r\n	<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Assessment</span></strong> - A Learning Object should assess whether the learner has achieved the stated Learning Objective. Learning Object authors have the choice of using traditional assessment methods such as quizzes (i.e., multiple choice, true-or-false, etc.) or non-traditional methods such as games and simulations.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;','Learning Objects','','publish','closed','open','','learning-objects','','','2011-12-20 16:59:05','2011-12-20 16:59:05','',31,'https://obojobo.ucf.edu/?page_id=54',0,'page','',0),

With Obojobo, your students have access to focused and concise instructional Learning Objects built using the Obojobo Editor.\r\n\r\nThese Learning Objects include a Learning Objective, Content, Practice and a scored Assessment.\r\n\r\nEach Learning Object created in Obojobo has a consistent interface. This means that it only takes the construction of one Learning Object to become familiar with the interface.\r\n\r\nEvery Learning Object you assign includes a scored Assessment that Obojobo collects and reports automatically. In addition, visualization tools allow you to dig deeper and see exactly how students interacted with the Learning Objects you assign.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the Obojobo system, read <a href=\"https://obojobo.ucf.edu/about/aboutObojobo.html\">About Obojobo</a> or <a href=\"https://obojobo.ucf.edu/about/obojoboFeatures.html\">Obojobo Features</a>.\r\n\r\n<h3>What are Learning Objects?</h3>\r\n\r\nRefer to <a href=\"https://obojobo.ucf.edu/about/learning-objects/\">this</a> article for information on Learning Objects.\r\n\r\n<h3>What do I do?</h3>\r\n\r\nYour interaction with Obojobo will be through the <a href=\"https://obojobo.ucf.edu/repository\">Obojobo Repository</a>. When opening this link, you will be presented with the Log-in screen. Continue reading for instructions on logging in.\r\n\r\n<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\nYou and your students will need a modern browser and an up-to-date version of the Adobe Flash plug-in. View the <a href=\"https://obojobo.ucf.edu/about/minimum-software-requirements/\">Software Requirements page</a> for the most up-to-date requirements.\r\n\r\n<strong>Note:</strong> A <a href=\"https://obojobo.ucf.edu/help/view/Student-Quick-Start-Guide.html\">Student Quick Start Guide</a> is available which can help explain the technical requirements to students. Distributing this resource is covered later on in this guide (inside the \'Example Posting\' section).\r\n\r\n<h3>Downtime &amp; Updates</h3>\r\n\r\nObojobo uses Twitter to handle status updates. Status updates include information regarding when upgrades are made to the system or when expected server outages will occur. These updates are shown in the Repository and through the Viewer Interface at the bottom of the log-in screen. This screen is visible when you or a student first visits Obojobo.\r\n<p align=\"center\"><em>System Updates appear at the bottom of the Repository &amp; Viewer log-in pages</em></p>\r\nIn addition, Twitter users can friend our <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/obojobo/\">Twitter account</a> to be informed of updates and changes. Alternately, you can use an RSS reader to subscribe to our <a href=\"http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/14709413.rss\">Twitter RSS feed</a>. Our account and RSS feed links are also provided on the <a href=\"https://obojobo.ucf.edu/\">Front Page</a> of our site.\r\n\r\n<h3>Logging-in</h3>\r\n\r\nIf you are a faculty or staff member at UCF you should already have access to Obojobo. You will need to provide your UCF NID and NID Password to gain access. To log-in,\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Open the Repository by clicking the link on the front of the Obojobo website (or, <a href=\"https://obojobo.ucf.edu/repository\">click here</a>)</li>\r\n	<li>If you are not already logged in, you will be asked to choose your log-in group. Click on \'UCF User Log-in\'.</li>\r\n	<li>Provide your UCF NID and NID Password.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nIf you are having issues logging in, the probable cause is that you need to reset your NID Password.

If you are following along, go ahead and log-in now. After you are logged in please continue reading the rest of this guide.\r\n\r\n<h3>Browsing Learning Objects</h3>\r\n\r\nIn order to use Learning Objects in your course, you first need to find a Learning Object that you would like to use. This is accomplished through the following steps.\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>In the Repository, navigate to the \'Public Library\' section. The Public Library contains Learning Objects that other users have contributed. These Learning Objects are available to all Obojobo users.</li>\r\n	<li>Select a Learning Object from the listing on the left-hand side of the screen. This is a list of all of the Learning Objects in the Public Library.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n	<li>Once the interface updates, it will show details about the Learning Object you have selected. Among these details, the most important piece of information is the Learning Objective. The Learning Objective describes what the Learning Object aims to teach and assess.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Previewing Learning Objects</h3>\r\n\r\nIn the \'Public Library\' section you can preview a Learning Object to see what a student will see. To do so, select a Learning Object in the Public Library, and then click on the purple \'Preview\' button. This will open the Learning Object in a new window. If you chose not to use the Learning Object you have selected, or would like to preview additional Learning Objects you can simply close this window to return to the Repository.\r\n<p align=\"center\"><h2>The Obojobo Viewer</h2></p>\r\n<h3>Distribution</h3>\r\n\r\nOnce you have found a Learning Object you would like to use, you will need to publish an Instance in order to utilize it in your course.\r\n\r\n<h3>Instances</h3>\r\n\r\nIn Obojobo terms, an <em>Instance</em> is a special type of Learning Object that is a copy of a Master Object; much like a compact disc or vinyl record is a copy that was pressed from an original master recording. The Learning Objects listed in the Public Library are like the master recordings - these are the pristine originals that are not to be used directly. Instances, on the other hand, are packaged and ready to be used and distributed.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<h3>Publishing Instances</h3>\r\n\r\nCreating an Instance is referred to as \'Publishing an Instance\'. Instances are what students will access, which means that the Assessment scores collected will be connected to that Instance. Since you would not want scores from multiple classes or programs to be lumped together into the same Instance, Instances created in the Obojobo system are targeted for one specific use. In other words, from one Master Object you can create multiple different Instances - one for each course, section, semester, program, etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition to recording scores, Instances have some options which you set when you publish an Instance. These include a name, a time period for when a student can access the Instance, when the Assessment is available, the number of Assessment attempts available to students, and the way in which Obojobo will calculate the final score.\r\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Each instance contains its own scores and options</em></p>\r\nThese are options that are provided to help you best utilize a Learning Object in a way that meets your demands and integrates with your course/syllabus.\r\n\r\n<strong>Note</strong><em>: These options describe one specific Instance, so each Instance you create can have different settings.</em>\r\n\r\nTo publish an instance please follow the directions below:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Navigate to the \'Public Library\' section in the Repository</li>\r\n	<li>Select a Learning Object from the Public Library.</li>\r\n	<li>Click on the purple \'Publish Instance\' button.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThis will bring up the Publish Instance dialog (shown below), prompting you to define the options for this Instance. Complete all fields, noting the help presented on the right-hand side of the dialog window which will guide you through the process. When finished, press the blue \'Publish\' button.\r\n\r\nYou should now be presented with the \'Distribute Instance\' window, providing you with the Instance link.\r\n\r\nThis link is important because it is what you will provide to students so they can access your Instance. If you close this window, note that this link (along with all of the information you entered when creating the instance) is kept in the Instance record.\r\n\r\nTo view an instance record please see the steps below:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Navigate to the \'Published Instances\' section in the Repository. This section contains every Instance you have published.</li>\r\n	<li>Select the Instance from the listing on the left-hand side of the screen. The interface will update to display the information about this Instance.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nFrom here, you can click on the \'Distribute\' button to re-open the \'Distribute Instance\' window.\r\n\r\n<h3>Example Posting</h3>\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to provide some user friendly information to go along with the link you plan on distributing to your students. Below is an example posting which could be sent via e-mail or posted in a Webcourses module. You are welcome to modify this example as you see fit.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Your instructor has assigned you a learning object via UCF\'s Obojobo system.\r\n\r\nTo access this Learning Object, visit this link: [PASTE INSTANCE URL HERE]\r\n\r\nFor more information on the link given to you or on the Obojobo system, please visit the brief <a href=\"https://obojobo.ucf.edu/help/view/Student-Quick-Start-Guide.html\">Student Quick Start Guide</a>.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<strong>Note:</strong> <em>The example posting above provides a link to the <a href=\"https://obojobo.ucf.edu/help/view/Student-Quick-Start-Guide.html\">Student Quick Start Guide</a>. This is a useful resource which you can provide to students to better orient them with the Obojobo system. In addition, this guide covers concepts they need to understand and explain technical requirements they will need to meet. It is recommended that you look at this document to see if it may be useful to provide to your students.</em>\r\n\r\n<h3>Editing Details</h3>\r\n\r\nOnce you create your Instance it is saved along with all of the options you defined when you first created it. If you wish to change these options (for example, increase the number of Assessment attempts or change the Assessment due date), click on the purple \'Edit Details\' button in the \'Instance Details\' tab in the \'Published Instances\' section. This will bring up the Edit Details dialog window which will have the same fields as the window used to create your Instance. Edit the values, then click on the blue \'Save\' button to commit the changes. The interface should update, showing you the new details for the Instance selected.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><h2>Scores</h2></p>\r\n<h3>Viewing Scores</h3>\r\n\r\nAfter you have assigned your Instance or Instances, students should begin completing Assessment attempts. Obojobo collects these scores automatically. At any time you may review the scores. This is done via the following directions:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Navigate to the \'Published Instances\' section of the Repository.</li>\r\n	<li>Select the Instance for which you want to view the Assessment scores.</li>\r\n	<li>Click on the \'Assessment Scores\' tab at the top of the Published Instances section.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis will bring up the Assessment Scores pane which features all student scores recorded thus far. Also included is a frequency distribution chart which allows you to see student performance at a glance.\r\n\r\n<h3>Downloading Scores</h3>\r\n\r\nYou can download scores into a CSV file for importing into other applications. To do so, click on the purple \'Download Scores\' button above the student score listing.This CSV file can then be imported into your Webcourses grade book. Read <a href=\"https://obojobo.ucf.edu/help/create/importing-obojobo-scores-into-webcourses.html\">Importing Obojobo Scores into Webcourses</a> for a step-by-step tutorial on how to do this.\r\n\r\n<h3>Viewing Score Details</h3>\r\n\r\nThe Assessment Scores window gives you final scores only; however, the Score Details feature allows you to dig deeper to see responses, question scores and attempt scores for a user. Clicking on the \'Details\' button beside the final score to open the Score Details dialog.\r\n\r\nRefer to <a href=\"https://obojobo.ucf.edu/help/create/score-details.html\">Score Details</a> for full documentation for this feature.\r\n\r\n<h3>Incomplete Assessments</h3>\r\n\r\nWhen students make an Assessment attempt, they are required to submit it when they are finished. Occasionally, a student forgets to actually submit the Assessment attempt. Un-submitted Assessments do not impact the final score, however, you can use the \'Score Details\' feature to see Assessments in progress or Assessments that were never submitted.\r\n\r\n<h3>Visit Visualizer</h3>\r\n\r\nThe Visit Visualizer tool allows you to see how a student progressed through an Instance, visit by visit and page by page. You can launch the visit visualizer from the Score Details window.\r\n<p align=\"center\"><h2>The Visit Visualizer</h2></p>\r\n<h3>Viewing Scores by Question</h3>\r\n\r\nThe “Scores by Question” is a powerful feature that allows you to see every recorded response for every question in the Instance. You can launch the “Scores by Question” feature by clicking on the purple button above the student score listing. This feature can be useful because it show you which questions students had the most difficulty with and how they responded. The overview tab lets you see a graph of which answers were more commonly chosen, while the student responses tab provides a list of each recorded response.\r\n\r\n<h3>Additional Attempts</h3>\r\n\r\nYou may be in a situation where you would like to grant additional Assessment attempts for one or more users, but not for all users. For example, a student may complain that they submitted an Assessment attempt accidentally and would like to take the Assessment again. By granting this student an additional attempt, they can receive another chance.\r\n\r\nTo do this please follow the directions listed below:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Navigate to the \'Assessment Scores\' tab within the Instance you wish to alter.</li>\r\n	<li>Then, click the \'+\' next to the individual you wish to add additional attempts for.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe total number of Assessment attempts available to a student is the sum of the number of attempts for that Instance plus the number of additional attempts that you have granted.\r\n\r\n<strong>Note:</strong> <em>If you would like to grant additional attempts to all users use the \'Edit Details\' feature to change the number of Assessment attempts available for the Instance. See the \'Editing Details\' section discussed earlier in this guide.</em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><h2>Advanced Features</h2></p>\r\n<h3>Sharing Instances</h3>\r\n\r\nThe Instance Managers feature allows you to share control to your Instance.

You can now specify how Obojobo calculates the final score for instances with more than one attempt. You may choose for Obojobo to use the highest attempt score, the most recent attempt score or to take an average of all attempt scores.</li>\r\n	<li>New - Editor: Short Answer questions have been revamped. Now you may specify a list of possible correct answer choices instead of a single correct answer.</li>\r\n	<li>New - Editor: We have added media capability for Multiple Choice and Short Answer questions.</li>\r\n	<li>New - Editor: We have added question bank features in the form of Question Alternates. This allows you to create one question that contains multiple alternate forms. To enable this feature, click on the ‘Options’ button in the Assessment section of the Editor.</li>\r\n	<li>New - Editor: The ‘Description’ field (in the Metadata section) has been transformed into ‘Notes’. We felt that the description field was too redundant with the Learning Objective. This more open-ended notes field is presented to you in the Repository but is not presented to students. Therefore this field is now optional.</li>\r\n	<li>New - Editor: You can now export and import questions using Respondus formatting.</li>\r\n	<li>New - Repository: We have created the ‘Visit Visualizer’, a tool that allows you to see a visualization of how a user progressed through an instance.</li>\r\n	<li>New - Repository: Reorganized drafts and masters to be listed in one list instead of separating them. This prevents having to switch between a drafts list and masters list.</li>\r\n	<li>New - Repository: Lists of users and scores now sort by last name instead of first name. In addition, filter controls have been re-written so that searches are more intelligent in finding what you are searching for.</li>\r\n	<li>New - Viewer: The display of the overview page has been streamlined. In addition, the course information is displayed to help the student better identify what the instance is used for.</li>\r\n	<li>Bug Fix - Fixed a bug that would drop most permissions when a draft object was turned into a master. Now permissions are preserved when creating a master from a draft.</li>\r\n	<li>Bug Fix - The Viewer was using the title on the Learning Object instead of the title of the instance. Now instances correctly use the instance title.</li>\r\n	<li>Bug Fix - Fixed an issue where left/right content pages flipped the content in the Viewer.</li>\r\n	<li>Bug Fix - Fixed an issue in the Viewer practice/assessment quizzes where the radio button of a possible multiple choice answer didn’t align vertically with the answer choice text.</li>\r\n</ul>','Version 1.3','','publish','closed','closed','','version-1-3','','','2011-12-17 00:41:44','2011-12-17 00:41:44','',0,'https://obojobo.ucf.edu/?p=239',0,'post','',0),

All instances published before these updates have this option turned on by default. You can disable this option by selecting an instance, selecting the ‘Edit Details’ button, and uncheck the ‘Allow past scores to be imported’ option. If a student accesses an object they have already taken (and this feature is enabled), they will receive a dialog giving them the option to either re-take the assessment or to import the highest attempt score from a previous attempt. If they choose to import the previous score, that score will be the resulting ‘Final Score’ for that instance and they will not be able to take the assessment again.

Detailed information and step-by-step instructions are available in the \'Creating Learning Objects\' section.\r\n<h2>What does Obojobo do?</h2>\r\nObojobo is a management system to assist you in the creation and administration of Learning Objects. With Obojobo, your students have access to purposeful and concise instructional pieces you design using the Obojobo Editor. As an author of Learning Objects, you are able to edit Learning objects for your particular need, view detailed information regarding your students\' academic progress, and share your creations with your colleagues.\r\n<h2>What do I do as a Content Creator?</h2>\r\nAs a content creator you have the ability to author Learning Objects as well as manage and share them with your colleagues. The Repository and Editor are the two interfaces you will use to create and manage your Learning Objects. The power of Obojobo is in its ability to author re-usable instructional components and implement them in different courses or instructional scenarios.\r\n<h2>Learning Objects</h2>\r\nRefer to the <a title=\"Learning Objects\" href=\"/about/learning-objects/\">Learning Objects</a> documentation  for a complete explanation .\r\n<h2>Logging-In</h2>\r\nRefer to the <a href=\"/help/faq\">FAQ</a> on Accounts for information on logging in.\r\n<h2>Creating objects</h2>\r\nYou will start by creating a Draft Object. Draft Objects are works-in-progress.\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Login into the Obojobo repository with your credentials</li>\r\n	<li>In the \'My Objects\' section, click on \'Start New Draft\' under the \'Drafts\' sub-tab to launch the Obojobo Editor.</li>\r\n	<li>The Editor will launch in a separate window. The Editor is divided into seven primary sections which will guide through the process of creating your Draft Object. Each section in the Editor is intended to do the following:<em></em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong><em>Metadata</em></strong>: to define basic information about your object including a title, language, description and an estimated time to complete the learning object.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Objective</em></strong>: to establish what your students are going to learn, or in other words, set your Learning Objective. You have two options for writing learning objectives: 1) using the Objective Builder in step 1 or 2) writing the Learning Objective without any assistance by skipping to step 1.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Content</em></strong>: Used to organize all of the pages that make up the content of your Learning Object. You can arrange your text and media files by choosing from a set of page layouts.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Practice</em></strong>: Used to organize interactive exercises, simulations and quizzes so that your students can practice the concepts they learned in the content section.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Assessment</em></strong>: Used to provide formal assessment as an indicator of academic progress regarding the Learning Objective you set for your students.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Keywords</em></strong>: Used to tag your Learning Objects for easy identification, classification, and discovery.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Finalize</em></strong>: In order to distribute a Learning Object that is ready for your students to use, you must \'Finalize\' the Object by ensuring all items in the checklist are completed.\r\n<h2>Saving Objects</h2>\r\nAs you build your object, you should save your work by clicking on \'Save\' in the lower right in the Obojobo Editor. Do note that each time you save; a new draft will appear in the list of drafts in the Repository.\r\n<h2>Editing Objects</h2>\r\nTo continue editing your Learning Object:\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Login into the Obojobo Repository</li>\r\n	<li>Select the desired saved draft from the \'Drafts\' list under the \'Drafts\' sub-tab</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Continue Editing\'</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Previewing Objects</h2>\r\nTo preview what you Learning Object will look like to your students, simply:\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Return to the Obojobo Repository</li>\r\n	<li>Select the draft object in the listing</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Preview\'</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Finalizing Objects</h2>\r\nWhen you are finished creating your Learning Object, head to the \'Finalize\' section in the Obojobo Editor. Finalizing the object will turn your Learning Object into a Master Object which you will use as the foundation to publish one or many Instances. For example, you could publish one Instance for your undergraduate course, a second Instance for your graduate course, and so forth.\r\n\r\n<strong>Note</strong>: <em>If your Learning Object has any incomplete sections, you will get an alert box notifying you to complete these missing sections before you can proceed.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Below is a step-by-step guide to editing incomplete sections</strong>:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Click OK to return to the Editor to address/correct the incomplete sections.</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Finalize\' when all sections are complete.</li>\r\n	<li>Close the Editor and navigate to the \'Masters\' sub-tab in the \'My Objects\' section of the Repository.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Deployment: Publishing instances</h2>\r\nTo publish an instance:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Log into the Obojobo Repository</li>\r\n	<li>Under the \'Masters\' sub-tab, select the Master Object you wish to use as a foundation for your new Instances.</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Publish Instance\' tab. A dialog box will pop-up to specify the name of your Instance, the course or program associated with your Instance, and the time frame in which your Instance will remain active for access.After publishing an Instance, Obojobo will generate a URL (link) to give to your students.To get this URl you need to:</li>\r\n	<li>Go to the My Instances section in the Obojobo Repository.</li>\r\n	<li>Select your newly created instance.</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Copy to Clipboard\' button under the \'Link; section in the \'Instance Details\' sub-tab.<strong>Note</strong><em>: You can publish multiple instances from a single Master Object - there is no limit.</em>\r\n<h2>Viewing Scores</h2>\r\nTo see the scores collected from your instance please refer to the following steps:</li>\r\n	<li>In the Obojobo Repository, open the \'My Instances\' tab.</li>\r\n	<li>Select the Instance you wish to view from the Instance listing.</li>\r\n	<li>Click on the \'Assessment Scores\' tab to display the scores along with a frequency distribution graph.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Downloading scores</h2>\r\nTo download the scores in a CSV format please read the following instructions:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>In the Obojobo Repository, open the \'My Instances\' tab.</li>\r\n	<li>Select the Instance you wish to work with from the Instance listing.</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Download Scores\' under the \'Assessment Scores\' sub-tab.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Continuing Development</h2>\r\nOnce created, Master Objects will remain intact; however, you could continue development of subsequent Learning Objects based on a Master Object by following these steps:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Login into the Obojobo Repository.</li>\r\n	<li>In the \'My Objects\' section under the \'Masters\' sub-tab, select the Master Object you wish to use as the source for your new Learning Object.</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Edit as New Draft\' to start a new Draft Object based on your Master Object.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Using Shared Objects</h2>\r\nObojobo facilitates collaboration among users through the Public Library section which contains Learning Objects contributed by other Obojobo users. To use objects shared by the Obojobo community follow these steps:\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>In the Repository, go to the \'Public Library\' section.</li>\r\n	<li>Select the Learning Object you wish to use from the list of available works.</li>\r\n	<li>When you find a Learning Object you would like to use, click on the \'Publish Instance\'button.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Note</strong><em>: Some objects will give you the option to create derivative works. Click on \'Create Derivative Work\' to receive a copy of the Master Object you would like to use. This copy can then be edited and modified to suit your needs.</em>\r\n<h2>Information for Students</h2>\r\nA quick start guide for students (similar to this guide) is available <a href=\"https://obojobo.ucf.edu/help/view/Student-Quick-Start-Guide.html\">here</a>.

After selecting a question type, you will need to click on the box directly beneath the question type box. This will lead you to individual screens based on your question type. Therefore, this guide will address each question format separately.\r\n<h2>Multiple Choice</h2>\r\nThis format will allow you to create a question to which a single correct response is chosen from two or more options.\r\n\r\nFirst, you must choose between two question formats\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Choose a \'Single\' (1 item) or \'Split\' (2 item) format for this question.  Items can be a text or media.</li>\r\n	<li>Choosing the \'Split\' format allows you to create questions with text and media.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSecond, you must enter the question/media you have chosen.\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>If you intend to use a question, you must type it into the box directly below and to the left of the format box.</li>\r\n	<li>If you wish to use a form of media you must select the \'Media\' box located directly below and to the left of the format box. This action will send you to the Media Assets page. To learn more about using Media Assets, please go <a href=\"http://https://obojobo.ucf.edu/help/create/media-assets.html\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\nThird, you will need to enter the different answer choices in the box directly below the the question/media box. These fields represent the possible answer choices for this question, with each choice automatically labeled A-Z.\r\n\r\nEach answer is in a text only format.This means that you cannot use a media type as a possible answer to your Multiple Choice Question. Also, in contrast to practice questions, assessment questions do not provide feedback.\r\n<h2>Short Answer</h2>\r\nThis format will allow you to create a question requiring a single correct response. However, within this format you must first choose between two question formats:\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Choose a \'Single\' (1 item) or \'Split\' (2 item) format for this question. Items can be a text or media.</li>\r\n	<li>Choosing the \'Split\' format allows you to create questions with text and media.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\nSecond, you must enter the question/media you have chosen.\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>If you intend to use a question, you must type it into the box directly below and to the left of the format box.</li>\r\n	<li>If you wish to use a form of media you must select the \'Media\' box located directly below and to the left of the format box. This action will send you to the Media Assets page. To learn more about using Media Assets, please go <a href=\"/help/instructors/adding-media/\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\nNext, you will navigate to the answer input field. Each value you enter here will count as a correct answer. The student will have to enter one of the possible answer choices as you have typed for them to receive credit. Answer input is case insensitive, but otherwise student input will need to match exactly.\r\n\r\nSince student input must match one of the correct answer choices exactly it is important that you enter all possible correct answers that a student may enter. For example, if your answer is \"Christopher Columbus\", you may want to include \"Columbus\" as an alternative possible answer. Note that \"columbus\", \"Columbus\" and \"COLUMBUS\" are equivalent since input is case insensitive.\r\n<h2>Interactive</h2>\r\nTo begin, click on \'Select media\' to choose the media file you used in the Practice section. The use of media for practice/assessment is an advanced feature, as you will need to create and select an Adobe Captivate media file that has quiz questions built-in. (Captivate files will need to be published to Flash 8 format).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://obojobo.ucf.edu/help/create/supported-media.html#Using_Captivate_Quizzes_in_Assessment_5\">Read more about Captivate requirements</a>','Building Assessments','','publish','closed','closed','','building-assessments','','','2011-12-20 15:03:56','2011-12-20 15:03:56','',468,'https://obojobo.ucf.edu/?page_id=280',0,'page','',0),

The key is to select the most appropriate medium to convey the facts, concepts, processes, procedures and/or principles of the subject matter in a direct and concise manner.\r\n\r\nBelow are some general guidelines to keep in mind when developing content, followed by specific guidelines for each media type.\r\n\r\n<h2>General Guidelines</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>Length</i>\r\n\r\nA good rule of thumb is to provide between 5-15 minutes worth of content per Learning Object, with no more than 2-3 media types at a time.\r\n\r\n<i>Diversity of Media</i>\r\n\r\nTry to provide enough detail in your content without using too much of one media type, as this can be overwhelming to the learner.\r\n\r\n<i>Consistency</i>\r\n\r\nBe consistent in how the information is organized throughout the Learning Object. This includes the layout, tone, organization of content, and instructional techniques.\r\n\r\n<i>Appeal to Students\' Interests</i>\r\n\r\nTry developing a plot for your content; possibly, one that leads your learners on a journey that fosters interest and encourages active involvement with your subject matter. Organizing content in a story format can turn academic delivery into a more engaging experience. For example, try adding a subtle plot twist or plant something in your explanation that is later revealed to have great significance or a deeper meaning.\r\n\r\n','Building Content','','publish','closed','closed','','building-content','','','2011-12-20 13:28:22','2011-12-20 13:28:22','',468,'https://obojobo.ucf.edu/?page_id=282',0,'page','',0),

Read on for more details on this process.\r\n<h2>Drafts</h2>\r\nWhen you start creating a new Learning Object, it starts life as a draft. As the name implies, a draft is an incomplete object. As such, the only people that will see your draft is you and any collaborators you decide to add to your draft object. Students will never see your Draft Object.\r\n\r\nIn Obojobo, each Draft Object has a corresponding version number. Each new draft begins at version 0.1 Each time you save, your draft\'s version number will increase - from 0.1 to 0.2, 0.2 to 0.3 and so on.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter aligncenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/draft-process.png\" alt=\"Figure 2: The Draft Saving Process\" />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 2: The draft saving process</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Masters</h2>\r\nWhen you are ready to distribute your object to your students, you must create a Master Object. Before you can do that, you will need to take your draft and <em>finalize</em> it.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter aligncenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/finalize-process.png\" alt=\"Figure 3: Finalizing\" />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 3: Finalizing</p>\r\nFinalizing a draft will convert the draft into a master. In contrast to drafts, which are evolving works in progress, masters are polished, complete, and set in stone.\r\n\r\nSince masters are complete products, they are suitable to share with other Obojobo users.\r\n\r\nTo finalize your draft,\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Login into the Obojobo repository</li>\r\n	<li>Go to the \'My Objects\' section</li>\r\n	<li>Select the draft object you want to finalize</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Continue Editing\' to launch the object editor</li>\r\n	<li>Click on the \'Finalize\' tab</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Create Master\' (shown below):</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter aligncenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/create/create-master-button.png\" alt=\"The Create Master button in the Content Creator\" />\r\n\r\nOnce you have finalized your object, you can find your newly created Master Object under the \'My Objects\' section of the Obojobo repository.\r\n<h2>Instances</h2>\r\nNow that you have created your master, you are ready to distribute your object to your students. To do this, you will <em>Publish Instances</em> of your Master Object. If you can imagine the Master Object to be the original copy, Instances are analogous to photo-copies of the original. In other words, you can create multiple Instances from one Master Object. This concept is demonstrated in the figure below:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter aligncenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/publishing-process.png\" alt=\"Figure 4: The publishing process\" />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4: The publishing process</p>\r\nThis means that you could create one Master Object, publish several Instances, and distribute an Instance per course section or among different courses. To the student, your Instance will look just like your completed Master Object, yet each Instance will contain its own scores (just like each course contains its own student roster).\r\n\r\n<strong>To publish an Instance,</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Login into the Obojobo repository</li>\r\n	<li>Click on the \'Masters\' tab in the \'My Objects\' section</li>\r\n	<li>Select your Master Object under the listing</li>\r\n	<li>Click on the \'Publish Instance\' button</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter aligncenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/create/library-pub-inst-button.png\" alt=\"The Repository\'s Publish Instance Button\" />\r\n<h2>Continued Development</h2>\r\nOver time, you may come up with improvements or changes for your Master Object. Fortunately, while Master Objects are set in stone, you can still edit them. However, once you start editing a Master Object it will begin life as a new draft. If you are editing a 1.0 Master Object, a 1.1 Draft Object will be created if you choose to edit. As you continue editing your new draft, the version number will change from 1.1 to 1.2, 1.2 to 1.3 and so on. Then, when you have completed your draft, you can finalize your object into a 2.0 Master Object.\r\n\r\nThere is no limit to the number of revisions - your Master Object can evolve from 2.0 to 3.0 to 4.0 and so on.','Drafts, Masters & Instances','','publish','closed','closed','','drafts-masters-instances','','','2011-12-20 15:15:51','2011-12-20 15:15:51','',468,'https://obojobo.ucf.edu/?page_id=284',0,'page','',0),

Navigating to this section will show you a list of your media, organized by name, file type, and upload date. This document outlines some guidelines for creating and using media in objects you author in the Obojobo system.\r\n<h2>Media Guidelines</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>File size always matters - The smaller media is, the faster it can be displayed.</li>\r\n	<li>Screen sizes - Your students will have an array of different screen sizes. We recommend designing for a <em>1024 x 768</em> resolution. This is also the minimum resolution supported for the Obojobo Viewer (the interface your students will use). If you do offer larger media, make sure they are still usable at a scaled down ratio.</li>\r\n	<li>Scaling Media- Obojobo will scale your content to fit the viewer\'s screen if needed. This may distort your images or make text difficult to read. You should try to size your media so that it works for your viewers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/create/previewing-media-size.png\" alt=\"The viewer offers some help measuring content sizes\" width=\"375\" />\r\n<h2>Images</h2>\r\nImages are a media type that can be incorporated within the section of our Learning Objects model.\r\nUses\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Illustrate, organize, or explain online content</li>\r\n	<li>Make pages visually appealing</li>\r\n	<li>Clarify your point(s)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Suggestions</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Unnecessary graphics can clutter your page and distract users from the content.</li>\r\n	<li>Use the best image format for the job, for instance JPEGs are typically better for photos than PNGs.</li>\r\n	<li>Make sure content isn\'t obscured as the content scales down to fit smaller screens.</li>\r\n	<li>Don\'t use images as a replacement for text, using text will make your content easier to output, re-use, and search.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Accessibility</h2>\r\nUnderstanding the needs of learners with different disability types and complying with accessibility requirements are essential when incorporating graphics into your learning objects.

As the owner, Obojobo allows you to add collaborators to your Learning Object with different permission levels. Read below for details on the available permission levels.\r\n<h2>Permission Levels</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Owner</em>: Owners have full rights to a Learning Object. This means that owners can edit, delete, change the permission level for users, add and remove collaborators, and publish Instances from the Learning Object. It is important to note that Instances can only be created from a Master Object.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Co-Developer</em>: The co-developer role is suited for allowing a user to help you develop a learning object without having the elevated power of an owner. Co-developers can edit the object, but cannot delete, cannot change permissions, cannot add or remove collaborators, and by default cannot publish instances.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Observer</em>: The observer role is designed to allow users to only preview your object. An observer can preview the object, but will be unable to edit the object, delete, change permissions, add or remove collaborators, and by default won\'t be able to publish instances.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese permissions have been summarized in the following table:\r\n<table class=\"inline\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"row0\">\r\n<th class=\"col0\">Permission Level</th>\r\n<th class=\"col1\">Preview</th>\r\n<th class=\"col2\">Edit</th>\r\n<th class=\"col3\">Delete</th>\r\n<th class=\"col4\">Modify Permissions</th>\r\n<th class=\"col5\">Add/Remove Collaborators</th>\r\n<th class=\"col6\">Publish Instances</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row1\">\r\n<td class=\"col0\">Owner</td>\r\n<td class=\"col1\">Yes</td>\r\n<td class=\"col2\">Yes</td>\r\n<td class=\"col3\">Yes</td>\r\n<td class=\"col4\">Yes</td>\r\n<td class=\"col5\">Yes</td>\r\n<td class=\"col6\">Yes</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row2\">\r\n<td class=\"col0\">Co-Developer</td>\r\n<td class=\"col1\">Yes</td>\r\n<td class=\"col2\">Yes</td>\r\n<td class=\"col3\">No</td>\r\n<td class=\"col4\">No</td>\r\n<td class=\"col5\">No</td>\r\n<td class=\"col6\">No</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row3\">\r\n<td class=\"col0\">Observer</td>\r\n<td class=\"col1\">Yes</td>\r\n<td class=\"col2\">No</td>\r\n<td class=\"col3\">No</td>\r\n<td class=\"col4\">No</td>\r\n<td class=\"col5\">No</td>\r\n<td class=\"col6\">No</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2>Additional Options</h2>\r\nBy default, users with the co-developer and observer roles will not be able to publish instances of the object (if that object is a master). You can change this setting by granting the right to publish instances. Note that owners can always publish instances.\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Adding Collaborators</h2>\r\nOne of the powerful Obojobo features is the ability to collaborate with your colleagues and designers. That is, you have the ability to add collaborators for the authoring of objects. Note that (as stated in the above section) you will need to be an owner to add or remove collaborators or modify permissions.\r\n\r\n<strong>To add collaborators to your object:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Login into the Obojobo repository</li>\r\n	<li>In the \'My Objects\' section, selected an object</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Share\'</li>\r\n	<li>Click on the \'Add Collaborators\' button in the Permissions window.</li>\r\n	<li>Select the name of the collaborator in the \"Users to Add\" list, then click the \"Add\" button. This will bring the selected user over to the \"Collaborators\" list on the right. When your finished adding users, click \'Next\'.</li>\r\n	<li>Select the permission level you want to give to the collaborators by clicking on the radio button. If you select \"Co-Developer\" or \"Observer\" you will be given the additional option of allowing the collaborator to be able to publish instances. By default this setting will be unchecked.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Removing Collaborators &amp; Modifying Permissions</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Select the desired object from the \'My Objects\' section</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Share\'</li>\r\n	<li>Select the name of the user you wish to modify the permissions for from the collaborators list.</li>\r\n	<li>Change the new permission level for that user. Select \'None\' to revoke all permissions and remove them completely as a collaborator.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Tip: </strong>Adding and Removing can be done in groups. You can select multiple users by shift-selecting. Control clicking also works.','Learning Object Permissions','','publish','closed','closed','','learning-object-permissions','','','2011-12-20 17:33:57','2011-12-20 17:33:57','',468,'https://obojobo.ucf.edu/?page_id=291',0,'page','',0),

Practice could be implemented through traditional self-assessment methods such as multiple-choice quizzes or non-traditional methods such as games and simulations.\r\n<h2>General Guidelines</h2>\r\n<h3>Practice and Learning Objective Connection</h3>\r\nAppropriate practice opportunities address the stated learning objective. In other words, practice should be in sync with the learning objective at hand.\r\n<h3>Scope</h3>\r\nPractice opportunities should address the different dimensions of the corresponding learning objective.\r\n<h3>Progression</h3>\r\nIn the early stages of practice, provide plenty of guidance and cues. As learners gradually advance to more challenging practice exercises, guidance and cues should be removed to facilitate the acquisition of skills delineated in the learning objective.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the learning objective entails problem solving, in the early stages of practice, the exercise should provide the rules needed to solve the problem, require learners to differentiate between correct and incorrect answers, and break the tasks into a step-by-step process. Then, in an intermediate problem solving exercise, learners would actually correct an incorrect answer to a problem, i.e., correct a non-example. Finally, learners could be asked to solve a problem without any help and to provide their own solutions.\r\n<h3>Interference</h3>\r\nTo minimize confusion or wrong association of responses to the different prompts incorporated in the exercise, the following design guidelines are helpful:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Chunk the content to be practiced in subsections to progressively introduce new material as learners master old material.</li>\r\n	<li>Compare and contrast similar practice exercises to help learners develop the expertise in the identification of the differences in the subject matter.</li>\r\n	<li>As learners acquire new knowledge, reviewing old concepts is also important.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Feedback</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Provide feedback on students\' performance along the way.</li>\r\n	<li>Provide corrective, substantive and/or remedial feedback as appropriate.</li>\r\n</ul>','Building Practice Questions','','publish','closed','closed','','building-practice-questions','','','2011-12-20 15:07:51','2011-12-20 15:07:51','',468,'https://obojobo.ucf.edu/?page_id=295',0,'page','',0),

Every object in the Public Library can be used to publish Instances and research ideas for a Learning Object of your own. Over time, the Public Library will grow in size and depth while providing a multitude of material and useful content for you to use in your course.\r\n<h2>Utilizing the Public Library: Creating Instances</h2>\r\nTo access the Obojobo Public Library, follow these steps:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Log into the Obojobo Repository.</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Public Library\' button located at the top of the page. A list of available Learning Objects will then be displayed on the left side of the page.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTo determine if you would like to use a public Learning Object in your course, follow these steps:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Select the Learning Object that interests you from the list.</li>\r\n	<li>Then, click on the \'Preview\' button.

Derivative works are essentially copies of Learning Objects that allow you to make changes to a shared Learning Object while keeping the original form untouched. Once you receive the copy of a Learning  Object, you obtain complete control of the new (copied) version.\r\n\r\nYou will know when you have the ability to create derivative works from a Learning Object because the \'Create Derivative Works\' button will not be grayed out.\r\n\r\nTo create a derivative work, please follow the instructions listed below:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Select a Learning Object from the list in the Public Library</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Create Derivative Work\'. This will copy the Learning Object and place an individual copy in your personal list of Master Objects (under the \'My Objects\' tab).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Note</strong>:<em>Not all Learning Objects in the library will allow this feature, as derivative works are at the discretion of the original creator. Please see \'Allowing Derivative Works\' below for more information.</em>\r\n<h2>Sharing Your Learning Objects</h2>\r\nThe Public Library contains all the Learning Objects that have been shared by the Obojobo community.In addition to utilizing Learning Objects in the Public Library, you can also contribute original works you create. We encourage individual creation since the more users contribute, the stronger the Public Library will become. Therefore, we also recommend that you share your objects when applicable.\r\n\r\nSharing is limited to Master Objects since Draft Objects are works in progress. Because of their unfinished state, they are not appropriate to share in the Public Library. For more information on this topic please refer to the <a href=\"https://obojobo.ucf.edu/help/create/drafts-masters-and-instances.html\">Drafts, Masters and Instances Guide</a>.\r\n\r\nTo share your a Learning Object, please follow the directions below:\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Log-in to the Obojobo Repository</li>\r\n	<li>Go to the \'My Objects\' section</li>\r\n	<li>Go to the \'Masters\' tab</li>\r\n	<li>Select the Learning Object you wish to share from the \'Masters\' list</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Share\'</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/create/masters-share.png\" alt=\"The Repository\'s Share Objects Button\" />\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A dialog will pop-up to explain sharing. Click \'Apply\' to agree to the terms and share the Learning Object.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Allowing Derivative Works</h2>\r\nWhen you share a Learning Object, you will have the opportunity to enable the option \'Allow Derivative Works\'. This option will allow your Obojobo colleagues to create copies of your Learning Object. In addition, they can then edit your Learning Object to suit their teaching needs (see \'Creating Derivative Works\' above). However, your original Learning Object will remain untouched and within your control.\r\n\r\nThis feature is useful if your colleagues would like to use your Learning Object but would like to make some changes or adapt it to fit their needs. Many users find this option beneficial, so we recommend that you consider enabling this option.\r\n\r\nTo allow derivative works please follow the instructions below:\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Log-in into the Obojobo Repository</li>\r\n	<li>Go to the \'Masters\' tab under the \'My Objects\' section</li>\r\n	<li>Select the Learning Object you wish to share from the list of Master Objects</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Share\'</li>\r\n	<li>Select \'Allow Derivative Works\' in the \'Options\' section</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Apply\'</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Removal</h2>\r\nYou are free to remove your Learning Object from the Public Library listing at any time. This feature is only enabled on Learning Objects that you own; thus, you cannot remove another user\'s Learning Objects from the Public Library.\r\n\r\nTo remove a Learning Object you contributed to the Public Library please follow the directions below:\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Log-in into the Obojobo Repository</li>\r\n	<li>Go to the \'Public Library\' section</li>\r\n	<li>Select the Learning Object you wish to remove from the Public Library</li>\r\n	<li>Click on \'Remove From Library\'</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/create/library-remove.png\" alt=\"The Repository\'s Remove From Library Button\" />\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>When you remove a Learning Object from the Public Library it will no longer be available for other users. However, any Instances that other users have created based on your Learning Object will continue to exist unless those users delete their Instances as well.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Deletion</h2>\r\nThe deletion of Learning Objects you have contributed to the Public Library is restricted. Since fellow Obojobo users may have published Instances from your Learning Object, it is possible that these Instances are open and scores are being collected. Therefore, deleting your Learning Object could adversely affect other users. Because of this, it is important that you are satisfied with your Learning Object before you contribute it to the Public Library.\r\n<h2>Extenuating Circumstances</h2>\r\nYou may find yourself in a circumstance where you need to delete a Learning Object from the Obojobo Public Library. For example, this is a necessary action in order to comply with a copyright agreement/expiration. If you are in a situation of this nature, please contact the Instructional Technologies Group (ITG).

However, any information you were working on will not be lost.\r\n<h2>Interface</h2>\r\nThe Repository interface is composed of four main areas (My Objects, My Instances, Media Assets, and Public Library) as shown below:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter aligncenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/create/repository.png\" alt=\"The Repository Interface\" width=\"500\" />\r\n\r\nAt the top, you have the four primary sections of the Repository including: 1) My Objects, My Instances, Media Assets, and Public Library. You also have the Feedback button (left), which you can use at any time to provide your thoughts, suggestions, or file bug reports to the Obojobo development team.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter aligncenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/create/repository-top.png\" alt=\"The Repository\'s Main Navigation Bar\" width=\"500\" />\r\n\r\nSecond, you will find the help section which explains what the feature or setting is. You may click on the \'Up-arrow\' button to hide the help section.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter aligncenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/create/repository-help.png\" alt=\"The Repository\'s Main Help Dialog\" width=\"500\" />\r\n\r\nThird, you will find the main work area where you edit and manage your Drafts Objects, Instances, and Media Assets. The interface in this area will differ depending on the section you choose to work on.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter aligncenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/create/repository-content.png\" alt=\"The Repository Main Content Area\" width=\"500\" />\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the Repository interface, you will find information and a menu to manage your Obojobo account. That is, you will see your user name, then the \'My Account\' button which will open up a window to change your personal info, password, and an option to set preferences. Last is the \'Log-out\' button which will log you out of the Repository.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter aligncenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/create/repository-bottom.png\" alt=\"The Repository\'s Bottom Controls\" width=\"500\" />\r\n\r\nContinue reading for more details about each area of the Repository interface.\r\n<h2>Main Sections</h2>\r\nThe Repository is split up into four primary sections:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>My Objects</li>\r\n	<li>My Instances</li>\r\n	<li>Media Assets</li>\r\n	<li>Public Library</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>My Objects</h2>\r\nThis section houses all of your Learning Objects. This includes any Draft Objects you have created, any Master Objects you have created, any Learning Objects that others have defined you as a collaborator, or any Learning Objects you have copied from the Public Library. To better understand the difference between Drafts Objects and Master Objects, please refer to the <a title=\"Drafts, Masters &amp; Instances\" href=\"/help/instructors/drafts-masters-instances/\">Drafts, Masters and Instances guide</a>.\r\n\r\n\'My Objects\' is the section you will see as soon as you log into the Repository. The \'My Objects\' section is split into two sub-sections: 1) Drafts and 2) Masters. Click on the corresponding tab to change between viewing your Draft Objects or Master Objects.\r\n\r\nThe \'Refresh\' button will update the corresponding listing.\r\n<h2>Drafts Tab</h2>\r\nWhen you click on a Draft Object from the list on the left side of the screen, you will see details about the Draft Object on the right panel.The purple bar at the top is the Action Bar which provides the following actions applicable to the selected Draft Object:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Preview</em>: Opens your Draft Object in preview mode which allows you to see and experience what your students will encounter when they access your Learning Object. Although this view is very similar to what the student will see, there are a couple of key differences:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Note</strong><em>:In the Assessment quiz, you will be able to see your answers immediately. This is not the case for your students as they will not receive their score until they have completed and submitted the Assessment. In addition, if your Learning Object contains any Media Assets, information pertaining to the available space and the size of the Media is shown in the upper-left corner of every media piece.</em>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Continue Editing</em>: opens your Learning Object in the Learning Object Editor. The Editor will open in a new tab or window. When you are done editing your object, you can close the tab or window to return to the Repository.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Permissions</em>: opens up the Permissions window. Under the \'Collaborators\' tab you can add and remove collaborators to your object. Note that you can only add or remove collaborators if you are an owner of the Draft Object. Also, in the Ownership tab, you may remove yourself from a Learning Object as long as another owner exists.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Delete</em>: deletes your Learning Object. Please know that deleting will remove your Draft Object completely, and cannot be undone. Clicking on \'Delete\' will prompt you to make sure you want to delete a Draft Object.</li>\r\n	<li>Below the actions bar, you have the \'Details\' area which includes:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><em>Permissions &amp; Ownership</em> which lists everyone (including you) who has ownership to this Draft Object. You can click on \'Permissions\' in the actions bar to modify permissions.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Draft Name and Version</em>: use to identify the selected Draft Object.\r\n<em></em></li>\r\n	<li><em>Object Details</em>: displays information about your Learning Object to help you identify it.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Masters Tab</h2>\r\nAs the name indicates, the \'Masters\' tab lists all of your Master Objects. When you click on a Master Object from the list on the left, you will see details about the Learning Object on the right panel.\r\n<h3>Masters Tab Actions:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Preview</em>: allows you to preview your Master Object in the student view, similar to previewing Drafts Objects.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Edit as New Draft</em>: begins a new Draft Object based on the Master Object you have selected.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Publish Instance</em>: creates an Instance of your Master Object for each course. This feature is important as each Instance will contain its own scores (just like each course contains its own student roster). For more information on Instances, please refer to the <a href=\"http://https://obojobo.ucf.edu/help/create/drafts-masters-and-instances.html\">Drafts, Masters and Instances</a> guide.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Permissions<em>:</em></em>opens up the Permissions window. Under the \'Collaborators\' tab you can add and remove collaborators to your object.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Note</strong>: <em>You can only add or remove collaborators if you are an owner of the Draft Object. Also, in the \'Ownership\' tab, you may remove yourself from an Learning Object as long as another owner exists.</em>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Share</em>: makes your selected Master Object available in the Obojobo Public Library so other users will be able to publish Instances from your Master Object. The Master Object will remain under your control.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Delete</em>: deletes your Learning Object. Please know that deleting will remove your Master Object completely, and cannot be undone. Clicking on \'Delete\' will prompt you to make sure you want to delete the Master Object.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBelow the actions bar, you have the \'Details\' area which includes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Permissions &amp; Ownership</em>: which lists everyone (including you) who has ownership to the Master Object. You can click on \'Permissions\' in the actions bar to modify permissions.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Object Details</em>: which displays information about your Learning Object to help you identify it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>My Instances</h2>\r\nThis section houses all Instances you have created, either from your Master Objects or from Master Objects in the Public Library.\r\n<h2>Instance Details Tab</h2>\r\n<h3>Actions:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Preview</em>: allows you to preview your Master Object in the student view, similar to previewing drafts.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Edit Details</em>: allows you to edit the Instance details instead of defining them for the first time.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Delete</em>: deletes your Instance. Please know that deleting will remove your Instance completely, and cannot be undone. Clicking on \'Delete\' will prompt you to make sure you want to delete the Instance.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Instance Details:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Link</em>: provides you the URL (link) you need to give your students so that they can access your Instance. Click on \'Copy to Clipboard\' and paste the link in the document (course web page, syllabus page, etc.) you will provide to your students.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Instance Details</em>: displays information about your Instance to help you identify it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Assessment Scores</h2>\r\n<h3>Actions:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Download Scores</em>: allows to download the scores of your Instances in a CSV file so that you may import the scores into other applications such as Microsoft Excel.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Instance Details:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Scores Section</em>: provides scores and basic statistical data including maximum, minimum, mean and standard deviation.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Frequency Distribution Chart</em>: provides a visual representation of how scores are distributed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Media Assets</h2>\r\nThis section houses any Media Assets you have uploaded.\r\n<h3>Actions:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Edit Media Details</em>: allows you to edit details about the Media Assets you uploaded such as the title, description, copyright.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Delete</em>: as the name indicates, this action allows you to delete the selected Media Assets you uploaded.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Page Details:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Media Details</em>: displays information about the Media Assets you uploaded to help you identify it.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Preview</em>: allows to view Media Assets to ensure you incorporate the right media into your Learning Objects.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Public Library</h2>\r\nThis page is the public repository of Learning Objects contributed by the Obojobo community.\r\n<h3>Actions:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Preview</em>: opens your Learning Object in preview mode which allows you to see and experience what your students will encounter.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Publish Instances</em>: creates an Instance of the shared Learning Object for each course. This feature is important as each Instance will contain its own scores (just like each course contains its own student roster). For more information on Instances, please refer to the <a href=\"https://obojobo.ucf.edu/help/create/drafts-masters-and-instances.html\">Drafts, Masters and Instances</a> guide.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Create Derivative Work</em>: creates a copy of the Master Object which you may edit. This option is only available if the user who contributed the Learning Object allows the Obojobo community to edit the Learning Object through enabling theis feature.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Remove From Library</em>: removes your shared Learning Object from the Public Library. Once the Learning Object is removed, Obojobo users will not be able to create new Instances from your Learning Object; however, any Instances created before you removed the Learning Object will not be removed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Note</strong><em>:Object Details which displays information about the shared Learning Object to help you identify it.</em>\r\n<h2>My Account Window</h2>\r\nYou may use this window by clicking on \'My Account\' at the bottom-right.

It requires the following information:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Instance Name</em>: This is the name of the Instance, which is what students will see when they view your Instance. When you create an Instance, by default this field will be the same title as the Learning Object name.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Course</em>: The course field is for you to be able to tag the course for which this Instance will be deployed. It is recommended that you follow the format of \'Prefix Number Section\', for example \'ENC 1101 08FallW59\' - the same format as Webcourses for UCF. Future versions of Obojobo will be able to automatically populate this field with a listing of your current courses.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Start Date</em>: This is the date when the Instance will be opened to students. A student will not be able to access the instance before this date.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Start Time</em>: Students will not be able to access this Instance prior to the start time.</li>\r\n	<li><em>End Date</em>: This is the date when the Instance will be closed to students. Students will be able to access the content and practice sections of the Instance after this date. However, students will not be able to access the assessment section.</li>\r\n	<li><em>End Time</em>: Likewise, students will not be able to access the Assessment of this Instance after this time.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Assessment Attempts</em>: This is the number of tries a student may take the Assessment. Currently, the highest score received will be the score that is reported. When viewing the Instance, students will see the number of Assessment attempts they have before they begin taking the Assessment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Instance Window</h2>\r\nThis window is displayed by clicking on \'Edit Instance\' (under \'My Instances\').This window is similar to the \'Publish Instance\' window - the only difference is that you will be editing the Instance details instead of defining them for the first time.\r\n<h2>Permissions Window</h2>\r\nThis window is displayed by clicking on \'Permissions\' after selecting a Master Object under \'My Objects\'.\r\n<h2>Submit Feedback/Bug Report Window</h2>\r\nYou may use this window by clicking on \'Feedback\'.This window allows you to submit the following\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Feedback</em>: Select this to provide any thoughts, ideas, complaints, or any feedback whatsoever.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Bug Report</em>: If you encounter a bug select this option to file a bug report.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Feature Reques</em>t: If you have an idea for a feature you would like to see in Obojobo, select this option.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Upload Media Asset Window</h2>\r\nThis window is displayed by clicking on \'Upload Media\' under \'Media Assets\'.Complete information on this window (as well as media guidelines) can be found in Media Assets on the Repository page.\r\n<h2>Edit Media Asset Window</h2>\r\nThis window is displayed by clicking on \'Edit Media Details\' for a selected Media Asset.

This is especially true when it comes to custom content and non-traditional Practice and Assessment features. Listed below are the supported media types of Obojobo.\r\n<h2>Supported Media Types</h2>\r\n<strong>Images</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>JPEG - (.jpg, .jpeg) used for photos and complex images. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jpeg\">JPEG on WikiPedia</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>PNG - (.png) used for high quality images with transparency support. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics\">PNG on WikiPedia</a>.</li>\r\n	<li>GIF - (.gif) used solid color graphics with limited transparency .<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format\">GIF on WikiPedia.</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Flash</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Flash CS3 - Flash 9 is recommended in most cases.</li>\r\n	<li>Flash 6,7,8 - Obojobo can load older Flash content, however there is no guarantee it will function properly. Unfortunately, there are some complex issues in Flash preventing flawless playback. We recommend only using older Flash content when necessary and only when the content is a simple animation that does not contain complex scripting. Captivate is currently the only exception.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Captivate: Using Captivate Quizzes in Assessment</h2>\r\nObojobo offers unprecedented quiz integration with Captivate 5. This feature allows you to easily create Practice and Assessment quizzes in Captivate; meanwhile, Obojobo will automatically detect when the student finishes and will report his or her score to the server.\r\n\r\nThis integration requires new/existing Captivate quizzes be built to the following standards:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Contains one quiz with as many questions as needed</li>\r\n	<li>Captivate file as a single .swf</li>\r\n</ul>','Supported Media Types','','publish','closed','closed','','supported-media-types','','','2011-12-20 16:01:10','2011-12-20 16:01:10','',468,'https://obojobo.ucf.edu/?page_id=305',0,'page','',0),

In the following, we will discuss text and text features in Obojobo.\r\n<h2>Length</h2>\r\nLength is an important issue, as too much may cause a learner to become disinterested. Conversely, if your text length is too short you may not provide the student with enough information to master the content. A good rule of thumb is that if the content consists of text a 5-15 minutes range should be based on the average reading speed of 200-250 words per minute.\r\n<h2>Chunking</h2>\r\nOrganize and chunk your content in one screen sections (maximum 250 words/screen) to facilitate easy reading and understanding of the content. Please remember this is not the time to write a book chapter or module. Choose what you want to write carefully so that you do not end up with excessive text.\r\n<h2>Tone</h2>\r\nAlthough writing style differs from person to person, a conversational tone is appropriate in the design of Learning Objects to maximize learner engagement and time on task. It is also important to remember that there is no such thing as \"good\" writing: there is only \"good\" re-writing. With that in mind, please be sure to check any text you include for spelling errors or mistakes.\r\n<h2>Bullets vs Prose</h2>\r\nConsider the inclusion of outlines with main or key concepts and principles; however, bulleted items as used in PowerPoint presentations are not enough. Remember, students will be accessing these Learning Objects on their own. You will not be there to expand on the bulleted items unless you plan to add an audio explanation with your text.','Text Guidelines','','publish','closed','closed','','text-guidelines','','','2011-12-20 15:55:26','2011-12-20 15:55:26','',468,'https://obojobo.ucf.edu/?page_id=307',0,'page','',0),

The default grouping (Attempts) will list the questions from each attempt starting with the first attempt. Question grouping is useful for Instances that allow more than one Assessment attempt. Grouping conveys how scores for each question changed over multiple attempts. In the example image (below) with question grouping turned on, you can see that the student improved their score for question 3 over two attempts.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/assets/images/help/create/about-score-details-window-3.png\" alt=\"Question grouping\" />','Score Details','','publish','closed','closed','','score-details','','','2011-12-20 16:05:53','2011-12-20 16:05:53','',468,'https://obojobo.ucf.edu/?page_id=309',0,'page','',0),

This document explains how to enable or disable this feature, covers how it works, and outlines the student user experience when presented with the option to import a previous Instance score.\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>Setting the Option</h2>\r\nWhen you publish an Instance, a check-box at the bottom of the \'Create Instance\' window (labeled \'Allow past scores to be imported\') provides you with the option of enabling or disabling this feature. You may turn this option on and off after the fact by selecting the Instance from the Published Instances section and clicking on \'Edit Details\'.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/create/instance-import-options.png\" alt=\"The \'Allow past scores to be imported\' option\" />\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>How it Works</h2>\r\nThis feature allows students to forfeit all of their Assessment attempts and instead import their highest previous attempt score in place of their final score. This option is presented to students only if they have already taken an Instance of the same Learning Object and you have enabled the \'Allow Past Scores to be Imported\' option.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Example:</em></strong> Assume that a student has previously taken an Instance from the \'Avoiding Plagiarism 1.0\' Learning Object. They had three attempts, in which they scored a 60, 80, and 90. If they later took an Instance you published from the same \'Avoiding Plagiarism 1.0\' Learning Object, then they would be allowed the option to import their \'90\' as their final score.\r\n\r\n<strong>NOTE</strong><em>:Version numbers count. Avoiding Plagiarism 1.0 and Avoiding Plagiarism 2.0 are considered two different Learning Objects.

They will not be forced to begin the Assessment as soon as they confirm not to import.\r\n\r\nIf a student chooses to import, they are presented with this confirmation dialog:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/create/instance-confirm-import.png\" alt=\"The confirm import window\" />\r\n\r\nIf they confirm the import dialog, they will be taken to the score page, which will show their one and only score.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/create/instance-score-screen.png\" alt=\"The score screen with the imported score displayed\" />\r\n\r\nBefore taking the Assessment, students are required  to decide whether to import their previous highest attempt score or to forgo the import option and take the Assessment normally. This choice cannot be undone. If they choose to forgo the import option, they will not be allowed to import their score later.

The bug detailed in this article has been resolved as of Obojobo version 1.3.2.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n=====\r\n\r\nObojobo is affected by a bug in version 10.0.32.18 of the Mac Flash Player (To see which version of the Flash Player you have, visit [http://playerversion.com/](http://playerversion.com/)).  This bug causes media questions in the assessment sections in the Viewer to sometimes not send a score to Obojobo.  The bug affects all Mac browsers.  Windows users are not affected.\r\n\r\nThe Obojobo development team is currently looking into this issue.  In the meantime, read below for more information on this bug as well as how to workaround it.\r\n\r\nDetail\r\n======\r\n\r\nThis bug affects media questions in the Obojobo assessment.  Media questions contain interactive components and graphics that differ from standard multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions.  In addition, media questions contain a \"Reload Media\" button.  You can see an example of a media question below:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/general/blue-bar-1.png\" alt=\"Figure 1: Reload Media Button\" />\r\n\r\nWhen you complete or submit the media question, a blue bar which says \"Progress Saved\" will pop-up underneath the media piece.  The bug will sometimes cause this bar to not show up.  If you **do not** see this blue bar after submitting or completing the media question, then your score for this question **has not** been recorded into Obojobo.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/general/blue-bar-2.png\" alt=\"Figure 2: Blue Bar Example\" />\r\n\r\nWhen you finish your assessment attempt, if you receive an \"Incomplete Question Warning\" dialog then one or more questions do not have recorded responses.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"mediacenter\" src=\"/assets/images/help/general/incomplete-question-warning.png\" alt=\"Figure 3: Incomplete Question Warning\" />\r\n\r\nIf you believe you have answered all of the questions and you receive this dialog, go back to each question (especially media questions) and make sure that you see the blue bar described above for each question.\r\n\r\nWorkaround\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThere are two available workarounds to resolve this issue:\r\n\r\n1. Completely close all browsers and restart your preferred browser.  In our testing this always resolves the issue.  Note that if you are in the middle of an assessment quiz, Obojobo can resume your quiz from where you left off.\r\n2. Use Obojobo under Windows (either through a Windows computer, a Windows Boot Camp install on your Mac, or through virtualization software such as Parallels or VMWare Fusion).\r\n\r\nIn addition, down-grading your Flash Player to an older version may resolve this issue, however this is not recommended as it imposes a security risk.\r\n\r\nWhen this issue is resolved this article will be updated.\r\n</markdown>','Mac Media Submission Bug','','publish','closed','closed','','mac-media-submission-bug','','','2011-12-17 01:23:16','2011-12-17 01:23:16','',0,'https://obojobo.ucf.edu/?p=313',0,'post','',0),
